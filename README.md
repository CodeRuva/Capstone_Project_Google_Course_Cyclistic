# Capstone_Project_Google_Course_Cyclistic
This is my final project for the Google Data Analytics Project.
## Synopsis
After completing my Google Data Analytics Project, I completed my capstone project to highlight the skills that I acquired throughout the course. These technical skills include being able to use Excel, BigQuery SQL, and Tableau to analyze data to derive actionable insights
## Overview
Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago, with a fleet of 5800 bicycles and up to 600 docking stations across the city. There are two types of memberships for this bike-share service: members with an annual membership and casual riders who usually purchase a single-ride or full-day pass.
## Goal
As a junior data analyst, my goal is to help my team develop marketing strategies that are aimed at convincing casual riders to sign up for annual membership and hence produce more revenue for the company.
The main question we wish to answer is **' How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?'**. Cyclistic can then assess why casual riders would purchase annual memberships and evaluate how they can use digital media to influence them to become annual members.
